# Assignment2
One of the best feature that I have improvised is asking for dynamically the number of player who are gonna play the game.
And I have implemented Menu class which is having four options:-
1. To start the game
2. To get the previous winners status
3. To play the game again ( This whole menu is running continous through infinite while loop)
4. To exit the game (using break keyword)
